The idea came to my mind by watching hulu website cloned website from travesy media 
<br>
Check out his video from https://youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia 

This project is not 100% cloned of main website of Netflix India

I have skipped some part such as  
1. Background videos around two image section
2. multilingual option in footer
3. Nav bar

I have learned a lots of css properties such as 
1. css grid
2. css flexbox
3. Custom properties

some javascript in faq section and not mobile-response website

A Good project to test our html and css knowledge
I will complete the skipped part as soon i will be free 

Thanks
